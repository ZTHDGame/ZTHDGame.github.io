The term “Services” includes, without limitation, our website https://zthdgame.io/ (the “Site”), mobile applications (each a “Game” and collectively “Games”), and any related services and content.  

If you do not agree to these terms or any future updated version of them then you must not access and/or use, and must cease all access and/or use of, any of our Services. If we require that any future update to these terms requires any action from you in order to accept the updated terms, then you may not be able to continue to use the Services until you have taken such action.

We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion.  If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications via the Services.

If that happens, unless applicable law requires otherwise, we are not required to provide refunds, benefits, or other compensation to you in connection with discontinued elements of the Services or for Virtual Items (as defined below) previously earned or purchased.

## PAYMENT TERMS

### In-Game purchases and Virtual Items.

We provide a service in the form of access to games, virtual in-game items or currency, including virtual coins, cash, tokens, or points (collectively “Virtual Items”), and our other Services.  In the Services, you may use “real world” money to obtain a limited, personal, non-transferable, and revocable license and right to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services solely for personal, non-commercial, and entertainment purposes.  Please note that purchasing Virtual Items only grants you a limited license to use them within the Services, and you do not acquire ownership of any Virtual Items. Your account and any related Virtual Items are owned by us and Virtual Items do not have “real world” value.

When you purchase Virtual Items in our Games on third-party platforms such as Facebook, Apple, or Google, we are not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform’s payment terms and conditions.  Please review the platform’s terms of service carefully for additional information.

For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to obtain a limited license and right to use the relevant Virtual Item(s) that will be accepted by us when we accept payment.  At that point, the limited license begins.

For orders to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items, by clicking the purchase/order button on the purchase window or page you:

Agree that we will supply the Virtual Items to you as soon as we have accepted your order; and
If you reside in the European Union (the “EU”), you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer have the right to cancel under the EU’s Consumer Rights Directive (as implemented by the law of the country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item.
You understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Items in our Services, you do not legally “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to “real” money or any credit balance in actual real-world currency.  The amounts of any Virtual Items or any “virtual currency” balance shown in your account have no value outside of the game (e.g., in the real world), and instead only constitute a measurement of the extent of your limited license.  We may modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time and at our sole discretion, with or without notice.

You are not allowed to transfer Virtual Items outside of the Services (e.g., in the “real world”), for example by selling, gifting, or trading them.  We won’t recognize those transfers as legitimate.  In addition, you may not sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for “real” money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game.  Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void, and we may terminate your Account because of it, among exercising other remedies available to us under these Terms or applicable law.

ALL SALES ARE FINAL: YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR ANOTHER PLATFORM SUCH AS APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER OUR SERVICES.

PURCHASES TO ACQUIRE A LIMITED LICENSE AND RIGHT TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.

Additional Payment Terms:

You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an account registered to you. We may revise the pricing for the Virtual Items it licenses to you through the Services at any time.

### Subscriptions

Some of our Games may offer subscription-based Services.  If you purchase a subscription (or if you activate a trial subscription offered free of charge for a certain period of time that automatically converts to a paid subscription of if not cancelled prior to the expiration of the trial period), then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that we begin supplying the subscription Services immediately and you are entering into a periodic subscription contract with us.  You are also authorizing a charge to you on a recurring basis of a periodic subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase.  By purchasing a subscription, we will automatically charge on a recurring basis the payment method associated with your account.  In addition, if you activate a trial subscription offered free of charge for a certain period of time and do not cancel the trial subscription prior to the expiration of that period, the trial subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription and begin charging on a recurring basis the payment method associated with your account.  For subscription Services purchased in a zthdgame Game played on a platform such as Apple or Google, the applicable platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply.  Please review the appropriate platform’s payment terms carefully for additional information.

Subscription charges will be applied to the payment instrument or method you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different payment instrument or method if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges, including the fees associated with any subscriptions or the prices for any Virtual Items, are subject to change at any time and in our sole discretion.  If we make a change to the periodic subscription rate in U.S. Dollars, we will let you know in advance.

Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until you terminate your subscription, or we terminate it.  You must cancel your subscription before it renews each billing period (or your trial subscription before expiration of the trial period), otherwise payment of the subscription fees for the next period will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method.  You are solely responsible for the timely payment of all fees and charges and in ensuring the accuracy of the payment information associated with your account.  If your payment does not process for any reason, your subscription may be automatically cancelled.

For subscriptions purchased through a platform such as Apple or Google (or for trial subscriptions that automatically converts to a paid subscription of if not cancelled prior to the expiration of the trial period), you may cancel at any time directly through the platform, as follows: you can manage and cancel your subscription at any time in your “Account Settings” of your device. For iOS subscriptions, please see Apple’s support page available here.  For Google Play subscriptions, please see Google Play’s support page available here.   

Except where required by applicable law, subscription payments are non-refundable and there WILL BE no refunds or credits for partially used subscription periods.

When you use these third-party sites and services, the third-party company may (or may not) ask you for permission to access your information and content. We are not responsible for these other companies’ content, business practices, or privacy policies, or for how they collect, use, or share the information they get from you.

##  TERMINATION

We have the right to terminate your access to, and use of, the Services, at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you.  Upon any termination, discontinuation, or cancellation of Services or your account, all provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive will survive, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and dispute resolution provisions.

##  INDEMNITY

If you violate the law or breach these Terms, and your violation or breach results in loss, damage, a claim, or liability against us, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from (which means you agree to compensate us for) that loss, damage, claim or liability, including our legal fees and expenses.  We may exercise exclusive control of the defense of any legal action subject to indemnification by you, at your expense.  You agree to cooperate in our defense of these actions.  We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any claim for which you are obligated to indemnify us.

##  WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS

We make no promises or guarantees that the Services or any content on them will always be available, uninterrupted, or error-free.  As set forth above, our Services’ performance may be affected by your hardware, software, and/or internet access, each of which we do not control.  In addition, we may suspend, withdraw, or restrict the availability of all or any part of our Services for business and operational reasons.

USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE CLAIM, WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, OR OTHER TERMS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED ARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR AVAILABILITY, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE IN THE SERVICES.

If your state or country does not allow these disclaimers, they do not apply to you.  If your state or country requires a certain period for which a warranty applies, it will be either the shorter of thirty (30) days from your first use of the Services or the shortest period required by law.

##  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER WE NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES (INCLUDING OUR CORPORATE PARENTS) WILL BE LIABLE:

FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY OR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE, OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, AND WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE; OR
FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES AND OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL WEBSITES OR RESOURCES.
THE RISK OF USING THE SERVICES AND EXTERNAL WEBSITES OR RESOURCES RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU, AS DOES THE RISK OF INJURY FROM THE SERVICES OF EXTERNAL WEBSITES OR RESOURCES.

If you live in a jurisdiction that does not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.

To the maximum extent permissible under applicable laws, the total liability of zthdgame and any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the services (including our corporate parents) is limited to the total amount you have paid us in the six (6) month period immediately preceding the date on which you first assert any such claim.

Some states or countries do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitations/exclusions of liability described above, which means these limitations/exclusions may not apply to you if you reside in one of those states or countries.  To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

Further, you and we agree to the jurisdiction of the courts in Santa Clara County, California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Services (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them), subject to applicable law and any mandatory jurisdictional requirements in your country or state of residence.  

##  AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

Notice of Claim and Required Informal Dispute Resolution Process

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination, or breach thereof, or your use of the Services, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution, through first contacting Customer Support and then through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described below. If these informal efforts do not resolve the concern or issue, we each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration  or small claims court, subject to applicable law, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.  

If you have any concerns about, or experience any issue with, the Services, most user concerns or issues can be resolved by contacting our Customer Support team at support@zthdgame.io.

If you have any concern or dispute that Customer Support cannot resolve, you agree to then try to resolve the dispute informally (the “Informal Dispute Resolution Process”) and in good faith by contacting us and providing a written notice of claim (the “Notice of Claim”) to the address provided below for Service of Process or by sending an email to legal@zthdgame.io. The Notice of Claim must provide us with an individualized and detailed description of the nature and factual basis of your individual, personal claim(s), and the relief you seek, including the specific amount of any monetary relief you seek and the basis for your calculation of that relief.  Your Notice of Claim may only include your individual personal claim(s) and may not be combined with a Notice of Claim for other individuals.  After submitting your Notice of Claim, you then agree to meet and confer by email, telephonically, or by videoconference (such as Zoom), in good faith regarding your individual claim before taking any further action.  

If any dispute related to your Notice of Claim cannot be resolved through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process within sixty (60) days of our receipt of the Notice of Claim, this Section explains how you and we agree to resolve it.  We each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.  You understand and agree that you and we are giving up the right to sue in court and the right to have a trial before a judge of jury, subject to applicable law..

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate

This Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or we may bring in court in accordance with Section 16 above:

(1) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and

(2) claims for preliminary injunctive relief for violations of these Terms.

This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you, subject to applicable law.  

Class Action and Representative Action Waiver

For disputes arising between us and you, or any other user, you and we agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. NEITHER YOU NOR WE CAN BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, subject to applicable law.

Changes to this Section

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that, if we make any future change to this Section, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to: legal@zthdgame.io, subject to applicable law.
